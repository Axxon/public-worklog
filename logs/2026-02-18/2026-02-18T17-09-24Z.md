### Technical Problems Addressed
- Hardened Keymaker by addressing UI behavior consistency during iterative front-end updates through component-level adjustments and progressive compatibility checks; scope 1 commits, 89 files, +2571/-509; surfaces vue(58), ts(27), json(4).
- Stabilized Architect by addressing API contract consistency under active backend changes through contract-preserving edits, scoped controller changes, and incremental hardening; scope 1 commits, 16 files, +2322/-25; surfaces php(11), none(2), fixtures(1).
- Delivered Keymaker: 1 commits, 89 files, +2571/-509; focus: frontend behavior and layout reliability; dominant extensions: vue(58), ts(27), json(4).
- Delivered Architect: 1 commits, 16 files, +2322/-25; focus: backend API and service logic; dominant extensions: php(11), none(2), fixtures(1).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a medium change set across 2 coded projects and 2 commits (105 files, +4893/-534).
- Concentrated effort in frontend behavior and layout reliability (85), backend API and service logic (11), cross-stack source maintenance (6) with dominant technical surfaces: vue(58), ts(27), php(11), json(4), none(2).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Keymaker (1 commits, 89 files, +2571/-509, area: frontend behavior and layout reliability); Architect (1 commits, 16 files, +2322/-25, area: backend API and service logic).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
