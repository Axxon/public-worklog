### Technical Problems Addressed
- Improved Neo by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 14 files, +107/-17; surfaces none(12), md(1), sh(1).
- Improved Cypher by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 2 files, +5/-4; surfaces py(1).
- Improved Architect by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 2 files, +10/-0; surfaces py(1).
- Delivered Neo: 1 commits, 14 files, +107/-17; focus: cross-stack tooling and configuration; dominant extensions: none(12), md(1), sh(1).
- Delivered Cypher: 1 commits, 2 files, +5/-4; focus: cross-stack source maintenance; dominant extensions: py(1).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a targeted change set across 4 coded projects and 4 commits (19 files, +130/-23).
- Concentrated effort in cross-stack tooling and configuration (12), cross-stack source maintenance (2), technical documentation and governance (1) with dominant technical surfaces: none(12), py(2), md(1), sh(1), php(1).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Neo (1 commits, 14 files, +107/-17, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration); Cypher (1 commits, 2 files, +5/-4, area: cross-stack source maintenance); Architect (1 commits, 2 files, +10/-0, area: cross-stack source maintenance); Oracle (1 commits, 1 files, +8/-2, area: backend API and service logic).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Managed binary artifact updates (2) with separate handling from text-based source changes.
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
