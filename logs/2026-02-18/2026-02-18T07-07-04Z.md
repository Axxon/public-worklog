### Technical Problems Addressed
- Improved Neo by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 7 files, +76/-21; surfaces none(4), md(3).
- Hardened Smith by addressing UI behavior consistency during iterative front-end updates through component-level adjustments and progressive compatibility checks; scope 1 commits, 7 files, +945/-331; surfaces ts(3), json(2), none(1).
- Improved Architect by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 3 files, +79/-67; surfaces none(1), lock(1), txt(1).
- Delivered Neo: 1 commits, 7 files, +76/-21; focus: cross-stack tooling and configuration; dominant extensions: none(4), md(3).
- Delivered Smith: 1 commits, 7 files, +945/-331; focus: frontend behavior and layout reliability; dominant extensions: ts(3), json(2), none(1).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a targeted change set across 4 coded projects and 4 commits (18 files, +1101/-420).
- Concentrated effort in technical documentation and governance (6), cross-stack tooling and configuration (6), cross-stack source maintenance (3) with dominant technical surfaces: none(6), md(4), ts(3), json(2), txt(2).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Neo (1 commits, 7 files, +76/-21, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration); Smith (1 commits, 7 files, +945/-331, area: frontend behavior and layout reliability); Architect (1 commits, 3 files, +79/-67, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration); Cypher (1 commits, 1 files, +1/-1, area: technical documentation and governance).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
