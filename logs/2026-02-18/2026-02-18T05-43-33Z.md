### Technical Problems Addressed
- Improved Neo by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 9 files, +249/-6; surfaces none(4), yml(2), md(2).
- Delivered Neo: 1 commits, 9 files, +249/-6; focus: cross-stack tooling and configuration; dominant extensions: none(4), yml(2), md(2).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a targeted change set across 1 coded projects and 1 commits (9 files, +249/-6).
- Concentrated effort in cross-stack tooling and configuration (4), automation and delivery workflow (3), technical documentation and governance (2) with dominant technical surfaces: none(4), yml(2), md(2), sh(1).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Neo (1 commits, 9 files, +249/-6, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
