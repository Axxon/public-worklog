### Technical Problems Addressed
- Improved Neo by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 15 files, +462/-24; surfaces none(9), md(2), yml(2).
- Improved Architect by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 10 files, +88/-16; surfaces none(4), yml(3), example(1).
- Hardened Keymaker by addressing UI behavior consistency during iterative front-end updates through component-level adjustments and progressive compatibility checks; scope 1 commits, 6 files, +18/-10; surfaces ts(4), none(1), playwright(1).
- Delivered Neo: 1 commits, 15 files, +462/-24; focus: cross-stack tooling and configuration; dominant extensions: none(9), md(2), yml(2).
- Delivered Architect: 1 commits, 10 files, +88/-16; focus: cross-stack tooling and configuration; dominant extensions: none(4), yml(3), example(1).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a medium change set across 10 coded projects and 10 commits (41 files, +623/-83).
- Concentrated effort in cross-stack tooling and configuration (22), automation and delivery workflow (7), frontend behavior and layout reliability (5) with dominant technical surfaces: none(22), yml(7), ts(4), example(2), md(2).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Neo (1 commits, 15 files, +462/-24, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration); Architect (1 commits, 10 files, +88/-16, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration); Keymaker (1 commits, 6 files, +18/-10, area: frontend behavior and layout reliability); Merovingian (1 commits, 3 files, +7/-2, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
