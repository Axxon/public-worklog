### Technical Problems Addressed
- Aligned Neo by addressing documentation and policy consistency across parallel updates through structured updates and consistency checks on canonical docs; scope 1 commits, 6 files, +78/-143; surfaces md(4), none(2).
- Delivered Neo: 1 commits, 6 files, +78/-143; focus: technical documentation and governance; dominant extensions: md(4), none(2).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a targeted change set across 1 coded projects and 1 commits (6 files, +78/-143).
- Concentrated effort in technical documentation and governance (4), cross-stack tooling and configuration (2) with dominant technical surfaces: md(4), none(2).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Neo (1 commits, 6 files, +78/-143, area: technical documentation and governance).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
