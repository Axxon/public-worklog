### Technical Problems Addressed
- Aligned Neo by addressing documentation and policy consistency across parallel updates through structured updates and consistency checks on canonical docs; scope 6 commits, 51 files, +850/-84; surfaces md(22), none(21), sh(6).
- Hardened Keymaker by addressing UI behavior consistency during iterative front-end updates through component-level adjustments and progressive compatibility checks; scope 4 commits, 18 files, +1002/-386; surfaces vue(11), ts(7).
- Stabilized Architect by addressing API contract consistency under active backend changes through contract-preserving edits, scoped controller changes, and incremental hardening; scope 3 commits, 17 files, +1116/-94; surfaces php(15), md(1), testing(1).
- Delivered Neo: 6 commits, 51 files, +850/-84; focus: technical documentation and governance; dominant extensions: md(22), none(21), sh(6).
- Delivered Keymaker: 4 commits, 18 files, +1002/-386; focus: frontend behavior and layout reliability; dominant extensions: vue(11), ts(7).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a medium change set across 3 coded projects and 13 commits (86 files, +2968/-564).
- Concentrated effort in technical documentation and governance (23), cross-stack tooling and configuration (21), frontend behavior and layout reliability (18) with dominant technical surfaces: md(23), none(21), php(15), vue(11), ts(7).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Neo (6 commits, 51 files, +850/-84, area: technical documentation and governance); Keymaker (4 commits, 18 files, +1002/-386, area: frontend behavior and layout reliability); Architect (3 commits, 17 files, +1116/-94, area: backend API and service logic).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
