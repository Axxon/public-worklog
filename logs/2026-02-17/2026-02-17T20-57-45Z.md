### Technical Problems Addressed
- Stabilized Architect by addressing API contract consistency under active backend changes through contract-preserving edits, scoped controller changes, and incremental hardening; scope 1 commits, 5 files, +36/-17; surfaces php(4), none(1).
- Improved Neo by addressing cross-stack compatibility across mixed source surfaces through incremental compatibility updates with regression-risk control; scope 1 commits, 2 files, +2/-2; surfaces none(2).
- Delivered Architect: 1 commits, 5 files, +36/-17; focus: backend API and service logic; dominant extensions: php(4), none(1).
- Delivered Neo: 1 commits, 2 files, +2/-2; focus: cross-stack tooling and configuration; dominant extensions: none(2).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a targeted change set across 2 coded projects and 2 commits (7 files, +38/-19).
- Concentrated effort in backend API and service logic (4), cross-stack tooling and configuration (3) with dominant technical surfaces: php(4), none(3).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Architect (1 commits, 5 files, +36/-17, area: backend API and service logic); Neo (1 commits, 2 files, +2/-2, area: cross-stack tooling and configuration).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
