## 2026-02-17:3

- Delivered a focused engineering iteration touching 3 codebases and 3 commits, mainly across: cross-stack tooling and configuration (4), frontend behavior and layout reliability (3), automation and delivery workflow (1).
- Primary challenge addressed: keeping behavior consistent through a targeted change set (9 files, +265/-36) across mixed technical surfaces (none(4), vue(2), sh(1), ts(1), php(1)).
- Mitigation approach: incremental compatibility updates, regression-oriented validation, and contract-preserving edits to reduce integration risk.
- Narrative remains sanitized: technical scope, challenge handling, and engineering outcomes only (no sensitive implementation details).
