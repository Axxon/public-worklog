- Coordinated cross-repository engineering work across 3 codebases and 3 commits to preserve contract consistency.
- Addressed the main scale challenge as a targeted change set (25 files, +209/-115), with emphasis on regression-risk control.
- Handled polyglot maintenance pressure across the most active technical surfaces: md(14), none(4), sh(2), php(2), vue(2).
- Kept the public narrative intentionally sanitized: only platform-level technical concerns and no product or implementation-sensitive details.
