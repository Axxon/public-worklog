### Technical Problems Addressed
- Stabilized Architect by addressing API contract consistency under active backend changes through contract-preserving edits, scoped controller changes, and incremental hardening; scope 1 commits, 411 files, +8920/-4328; surfaces php(403), none(3), json(1).
- Delivered Architect: 1 commits, 411 files, +8920/-4328; focus: backend API and service logic; dominant extensions: php(403), none(3), json(1).

### Delivery Evidence
- Quantified a high-volume change set across 1 coded projects and 1 commits (411 files, +8920/-4328).
- Concentrated effort in backend API and service logic (403), cross-stack tooling and configuration (3), cross-stack source maintenance (3) with dominant technical surfaces: php(403), none(3), json(1), lock(1), yml(1).
- Captured project-coded evidence: Architect (1 commits, 411 files, +8920/-4328, area: backend API and service logic).
- Validated this iteration using deterministic git-derived evidence (no local Codex session seeds captured for this time window).
- Kept output recruiter-readable and sanitized: project code names only, no repo names, no paths, no endpoints, no product-sensitive internals.
